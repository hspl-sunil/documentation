VAT units
=========

A **VAT unit** is a group of VAT-taxable entities that are legally independent of each other, but
are closely linked financially, organizationally, and economically and therefore considered one and
the same VAT-taxable entity.

.. example::
   Enterprise **A** owes 300.000,00€ of VAT taxes and enterprise **B** can recover 280.000,00€ of
   VAT taxes. They form up as a **VAT unit** so that the two amounts balance out, and must
   conjointly only pay 20.000,00€ of VAT taxes.

Configuration
=============

.. note::
   This is only applicable for multi-company environments.

To create or modify a **VAT unit**, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> General Settings`, scroll
down to the :guilabel:`Companies` section, and click :guilabel:`Manage Companies`. Select a company
to be part of the **VAT unit**, and click the :menuselection:`VAT Units --> Add a line`.
:guilabel:`Select` an existing one, or :guilabel:`Create` a new one. Name the **VAT unit**, select
the :guilabel:`Country`, the :guilabel:`Companies` of the unit, the :guilabel:`Main Company` (which
serves as representative), and the :guilabel:`Tax ID` of the :guilabel:`Main Company`.
